**12.2.** Amendment. This Agreement may only be modified or supplemented by a written instrument referencing this Agreement, which is duly signed by each Party. 

**12.3.** Precedence. To the extent of any conflict or inconsistency between a provision in this Agreement on the one hand, and a provision in the Order on the other hand, the former shall prevail (except to the extent expressly stated otherwise in the Order, or to the extent related solely to the commercial or technical particulars of the Order, in which case the latter shall prevail).  

**12.4.** Third Party Content. The Service may present, or otherwise allow Customer to view, access, link to, and/or interact with, Content from third parties and other sources that are not owned or controlled by Company (such Content, "**Third Party Content**"). The Service may also enable Customer to communicate with the related third parties. The display or communication to Customer of such Third Party Content does not (and shall not be construed to)in any way imply, suggest, or constitute any sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Company of such Third Party Content or third party, nor any affiliation between Company and such third party. Company shall have no obligation or liability of any kind whatsoever for Third Party Content or for the third party's policies, practices, actions, or omissions. If Customer enables or uses Third Party Content with the Service, Company will allow the Third Party Content providers to access and use Customer Content as required for the interoperation of the Third Party Content and the Service. Any Third Party Content provider's use of Customer Content is subject to the applicable agreement between Customer and the Third Party Content provider.

**12.5.** Third Party Software. The Service may include what is commonly referred to as 'open source' software.  Under some of their respective license terms and conditions, Company may be required to provide Customer with notice of the license terms and attribution to the third party, in which case Company may provide Customer with such information (whether via the Service, via the Site, or otherwise). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the open source software will be subject to the license terms and conditions applicable to such open source software, to the extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms and conditions shall not restrict the license rights granted to Customer hereunder), and to the extent any such license terms and conditions grant Customer rights that are inconsistent with the limited rights granted to Customer in this Agreement, then such rights in the applicable open source license shall take precedence over the rights and restrictions granted in this Agreement, but solely with respect to such open source software. Company will comply with any valid written request submitted by Customer to Company for exercising any rights Customer may have under such license terms and conditions.

**12.6.** Assignment. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Customer, in whole or in part, without the Company's prior express written consent. Company may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without restriction or obligation. Furthermore, any Company obligation hereunder may be performed (in whole or in part), and any Company right (including invoice and payment rights) or remedy may be exercised (in whole or in part), by an Affiliate of Company. Any prohibited assignment will be null and void. Subject to the provisions of this Section *(Assignment)*, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each Party and its respective successors and assigns.

**12.7.** Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada, without regard to any conflicts of laws, rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement and are hereby disclaimed. Any claim, dispute or controversy between the Parties will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in Toronto, Ontario, and each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waives any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may seek equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY. EXCEPT TO SEEK EQUITABLE RELIEF, PAYMENT OF FEES, OR TO OTHERWISE PROTECT OR ENFORCE APARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS, NO ACTION, REGARDLESS OF FORM, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT BY EITHER PARTY MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITY AROSE. Any claims or damages that Customer may have against Company shall only be enforceable against Company, and not any other entity or Company's officers, directors, representatives, employees, or agents.  

**12.8.** Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then: (a) the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace the provision with a provision that is legal, valid and enforceable and that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified in respect of such jurisdiction. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it as aforesaid, then such provision will be ineffective solely as to such jurisdiction, and will be substituted (in respect of such jurisdiction) with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that most closely approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision.   

**12.9.** Waiver and Remedies. No failure or delay on the part of either Party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof, or the exercise of any other right or remedy. Any waiver granted hereunder must be in writing, duly signed by the waiving Party, and will be valid only in the specific instance in which it is given. Except as may be expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy conferred upon or reserved by either Party under this Agreement is intended to be, or will be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy under this Agreement, at law, or in equity, but will be cumulative of such other rights and remedies.

**12.13.** Relationship. The relationship of the Parties is solely that of independent contractors, neither Party nor its employees are the servants, agents, or employees of the other, and no exclusivities arise out of this Agreement.
